Hi

Thank you for downloading these source files and your interest in my book.

The file names relate directly to the program number used in each chapter.
Thus the file 'prog3a.s' is the source file for Program 3a in the book.
Files may require running, assembling and executing in different ways 
depending on their structure, so please check the book at the apprioriate point.

These file will work with all versions of the Raspberry Pi (as per July 2016) - RPi 3, RPi2, RPi1 & RPi Zero.
Some, esepecially those relating to programming the GPIO port may require minor modifications.
This is highligted in the text of the book at the appropriate point,a dn wioth comments in the source files.

Please do check out my website at www.brucesmith.info.

Keep healthy.
